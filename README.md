I have made my own RepRap 3D Printer a few days ago.

But I found That LCD2004 and LCD 12864 are hard to use,
so I want to make a screen by myself which is easy to use.

Then I make a Touch Screen for my printer.

It can work with Mega2560+Ramps1.4 well.

You can get it from this link:https://cxdiy.taobao.com/
